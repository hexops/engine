# mach/freetype - Ziggified FreeType 2 bindings [![CI](https://github.com/hexops/mach-freetype/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hexops/mach-freetype/actions) <a href="https://hexops.com"><img align="right" alt="Hexops logo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hexops/media/main/readme.svg"></img></a>

Ziggified FreeType 2 bindings that [Mach engine](https://github.com/hexops/mach) uses, with zero-fuss installation, cross compilation, and more.

This repository is a separate copy of the same library in the [main Mach repository](https://github.com/hexops/mach), and is automatically kept in sync, so that anyone can use this library in their own project / engine if they like!

## Zero fuss installation, cross compilation, and more

[Just as with Mach](https://github.com/hexops/mach#zero-fuss-installation--cross-compilation), you get zero fuss installation & cross compilation using these Freetype bindings. **only `zig` and `git` are needed to build from any OS and produce binaries for every OS.** No system dependencies at all.

## Issues

Issues are tracked in the [main Mach repository](https://github.com/hexops/mach/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afreetype).

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome. Pull requests must be sent to [the main repository](https://github.com/hexops/mach/tree/main/freetype) to avoid some complex merge conflicts we'd get by accepting contributions in both repositories. Once the changes are merged there, they'll get sync'd to this repository automatically.
