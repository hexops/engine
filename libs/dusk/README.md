# mach/dusk - WebGPU implementation in Zig

This repository is a separate copy of the same library in the [main Mach repository](https://github.com/hexops/mach), and is automatically kept in sync, so that anyone can use this library in their own project if they like!

## Issues

Issues are tracked in the [main Mach repository](https://github.com/hexops/mach/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adusk).

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome. Pull requests must be sent to [the main repository](https://github.com/hexops/mach/tree/main/libs/dusk) to avoid some complex merge conflicts we'd get by accepting contributions in both repositories. Once the changes are merged there, they'll get sync'd to this repository automatically.
